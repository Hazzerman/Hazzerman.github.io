      <p>In Chapter 3 we used p-values still, but measured the relationship between variables and the effectiveness of certain correlations as experiments or observational studies. We looked at how to determine convincing evidence for correlation, and how to determine explanatory variables.</p>
	  <br>
	  <b>Investigations 3.1 and 3.2: Teen Hearing Loss (cont.) and Near-Sightedness</b><br><br>
	  <b><u>Key Terms</u></b>
	  <p><b>Conditional Proportions:</b> These measure the difference in the proportion of successes between two groups, and are calculated seperately for each group.</p>
	  <p><b>Explanatory/Response Variable:</b> When two variables interact, we expect one (explanatory) to influence the other (response).</p>
	  <p><b>Confounding Variables:</b> When the involved variables are neither explanatory nor response, then they are confounding and <em>may</em> have a potential effect on both the response variable and the explanatory variable.</p>
	  <p><b>Two Proportion z-Test: </b>This compares two proportions when the assumption is that the null hypothesis is true, and thus the two samples are from the same population. The p-value obtained here demonstrates the likelihood of achieving certain relationships between proportions simply from random sampling. The only condition that must be passed here is that there are at least 5 successes and 5 failures in each group.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p>The continuation of this study involved comparing the relation between hearing loss and earbud use. We used samples to determine proportions and then evaluate the hearing loss results with estimating the likelihood of such a variance occurring by chance alone. We did discover hearing loss had increased from 1994 to 2006, but not necessarily because of earbuds. Next, we investigated the development of myopia and night light use in infanthood. We were able to calculate that indeed there is strong evidence that their is a relationship between night light use and myopia, but conclusions beyond this is pure speculation.</p>
	  <br><br>
	  <b>Investigations 3.3 - 3.5: Handwriting and SAT Scores/Have a Nice Trip/Botox for Back Pain</b><br><br>
	  <b><u>Key Terms</u></b>
	  <p><b>Observational Study:</b> A study where researchers passively observe participants and/or observational units.</p>
	  <p><b>Experimental Study:</b> A study where researchers actively impose an explanatory variable upon the observational units in order to record information about a response variable.</p>
	  <p><b>Random Assignment:</b> Experimental units are randomly assigned to the treatment groups, with each unit being equally likely to be assigned any of the given treatments.</p>
	  <p>In these studies we looked at correlational statistics and evaluating probable confounding variables. In 3.1, we evaluated the likelihood of cursive alone causing a higher SAT score. In 3.4 we investigated how to properly set up an experiment such that confounding variables are minimized, such as randomizing the sample population and the treatment of experimental units. Finally, 3.5 investigated the effectiveness of testing botox in this study. In studying randomized experiments, we can use a t-test to analyze the results. We have the luxury of drawing a cause-and-effect because this is exactly what we're measuring in our statistical tests.</p>
	  <br><br>
	  <b>Investigations 3.6 and 3.8: Dolphin Therapy and  </b><br><br>
	  <b><u>Key Terms</u></b>
	  <p><b>Fisher's Exact Test</b> This is a way of determining a p-value for a two way table using the hypergeometric probabilities.</p>
	  <p><b>Relative Risk: </b>The ratio of the conditional proportions, intentionally set up so the value is larger than one.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p>Investigations 3.6 and 3.8 studied the effectiveness of certain treatments, one of dolphin therapy, the other of CPR. Using the dolphins to improve patients' depressive symptoms, we investigated the likelihood of 10 out of 15 patients seeing improvement if patients were impartial to the therapy, which seemed quite unlikely. We could conclude quite a strong connection here. Similarly, when 3.8 studied the effectiveness of only telling bystanders how to perform CC, not CPR. We used p-values and two-sample z-tests to consider the results of the study "convincing" but not necessarily "significant."</p>
